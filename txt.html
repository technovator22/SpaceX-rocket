    <h3 class = "h"> Falcon 1 </h3>
    <p> SpaceX's first launch vehicle, now retired.
        Falcon 1 was SpaceX's first rocket and a pivotal achievement in commercial spaceflight history. A two-stage rocket designed to carry small payloads to orbit, it became the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit in 2008. Its maiden flight was on March 24, 2006, but it wasn't until its fourth attempt that it successfully reached orbit. This milestone demonstrated the viability of SpaceX's innovative, cost-effective approach to space exploration. Falcon 1 was retired after five flights, paving the way for the development of the more powerful and versatile Falcon 9, which continues to drive SpaceX's success. ðŸš€</p>

    <h3 class = "hh"> Falcon 9 </h3>
    <p> A two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift launch vehicle.Falcon 9, SpaceXâ€™s workhorse rocket, is a two-stage launch vehicle designed for reliable and safe transport of satellites and the Dragon spacecraft into orbit. It was first launched in June 2010. The rocket is notable for its reusability; its first stage can land back on Earth and be used again, significantly reducing costs. Falcon 9 has been instrumental in various missions, including resupplying the ISS, launching satellites, and ferrying astronauts. The rocket's success lies in its versatility and innovation, making it a cornerstone of SpaceXâ€™s mission to revolutionize space travel. ðŸš€</p>

    <h3 class = "hhh"> Falcon Heavy </h3>
    <p> Essentially three Falcon 9 rockets strapped together, it's the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two.
        Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world, is a marvel of modern engineering by SpaceX. First launched in February 2018, it features three Falcon 9 cores strapped together, giving it extraordinary thrust. With the capability to lift over 63,800 kg to Low Earth Orbit, Falcon Heavy is designed for missions carrying large payloads, including interplanetary journeys. Its reusability further reduces launch costs, with all three boosters capable of landing back on Earth. The rocket's inaugural flight famously carried Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster into space, showcasing its immense potential and pushing the boundaries of space exploration. ðŸš€</p>

    <h3 class = "hhhh"> Dragon </h3>
    <p>A spacecraft used for cargo and crew missions to the International Space Station (ISS).Dragon, SpaceX's pioneering spacecraft, is designed for cargo and crew missions to the International Space Station (ISS). First launched in December 2010, Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the ISS in 2012. The crewed version, Crew Dragon, debuted in May 2020 with the Demo-2 mission, safely transporting astronauts to and from the ISS. Dragon is known for its reusability and versatility, featuring advanced safety systems and the capability to carry up to seven astronauts. It's a cornerstone of SpaceX's goal to revolutionize space travel and facilitate human exploration of space. ðŸš€</p>

    <h3 class = "hhhhh"> Starship </h3>
    <p>An advanced spacecraft designed for missions to Mars and beyond.
        Starship, SpaceX's ambitious spacecraft, is designed for deep-space missions, including trips to Mars and beyond. Combining a fully reusable rocket and spacecraft in one, Starship aims to revolutionize space travel with its immense payload capacity and cost efficiency. The spacecraft features a stainless steel structure, advanced heat shield, and Raptor engines for impressive thrust. Starship's first successful high-altitude flight and landing occurred in May 2021. Its development represents a significant step towards making life multi-planetary, a core goal of SpaceX. Starship promises to enable unprecedented exploration and colonization of other planets. ðŸŒŒ</p>
